    <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #555; margin: 10px 0;">
        At the beginning of my journey, before participating in this 
        prestigious competition, I had the opportunity to take part 
        in the STEM Science Innovation competition at the state level in 
        Selangor. My friends and I proudly represented our school in this event, 
        which marked the start of a meaningful and enriching experience for all of us.
In this competition, we were given a challenging yet exciting task: to create
 an innovative product that could bring significant benefits to the environment. 
 This task sparked countless brainstorming sessions as we worked together to come 
 up with an idea that was both impactful and practical. It was not an easy process. 
 We spent a considerable amount of time discussing and analyzing various possibilities, 
 facing obstacles and learning through trial and error along the way.
One of the major challenges we encountered was managing the cost of materials
 for our innovation. As students, we had limited resources, which required us to 
 think creatively and strategically to ensure our project remained feasible. To overcome this hurdle, 
 we sought advice and guidance from our school advisor as well as an external expert, Mr. Hafizan, a 
 lecturer from the University of Malaya. Their insights and encouragement were invaluable, providing 
 us with clarity and confidence as we refined our project.

After much deliberation and planning, we unanimously decided to develop a soap product as our innovation. This was not just any soap; it was made from used cooking oil, which we processed and transformed into hand soap. This idea aligned perfectly with our mission to create something beneficial for the environment by promoting the reuse of waste materials.

The process of creating the product was both challenging and rewarding. It required meticulous attention to detail, teamwork, and resilience. Each step brought new lessons and strengthened our bond as a team. We faced setbacks, but our shared determination and passion kept us moving forward.

Finally, after all our hard work and dedication, we presented our innovation at the competition. Alhamdulillah, we were honored to achieve second place at the state level in Selangor. This accomplishment was a moment of immense pride and joy for all of us. It validated our efforts and showed us that with perseverance, collaboration, and the right mindset, we could achieve great things.

This experience not only taught us the value of innovation but also deepened our appreciation for teamwork and environmental responsibility. It became a stepping stone for future opportunities and a memory we will cherish forever.   </p>

During the early stages of the Covid-19
 pandemic, this marked the beginning of my
  journey in participating in this competition. I was invited by 
  the school to represent them in the event, and I was entrusted with the role of Co-Leader.
   This position carried significant responsibilities, as I had to manage the team and oversee 
   the innovative product we developed.It was a major challenge,
    as there were many limitations and obstacles during the competition.
     However, we were confident that with the opportunity we had, our product had 
     the potential to make a significant impact, especially given the current situation of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The timing was ideal because our product focused on hygiene and
 cleanlinessâ€”a critical aspect during the pandemic when maintaining 
 cleanliness became a top priority for society. We believed that our 
 innovation could not only address the immediate needs of the public 
 but also play a vital role in promoting hygiene awareness in challenging times like these.

       Alhamdulillah, after putting in immense effort and dedication, we were honored to achieve the prestigious Gold Award in the Asian Youth Innovation Award competition. This accomplishment is a testament to the hard work, perseverance, and teamwork that went into preparing for this moment.

I am truly grateful and humbled by this recognition, as it reflects not only our commitment to innovation but also the support and encouragement from everyone around us. This achievement motivates me to aim even higher and continue striving for excellence in the future.

All praises and thanks to Allah for making this possible, and I sincerely appreciate everyone who contributed to this success. It is a moment of pride and joy that I will cherish forever.
